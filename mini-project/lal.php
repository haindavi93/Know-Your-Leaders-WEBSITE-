        <p>Shastri was born on 2 October 1904 at the home of his maternal grandparents in Mughalsarai in a Kayastha Hindu family. 
		Shastri's paternal ancestors had been in the service of the zamindar of Ramnagar, Varanasi and 
		Shastri lived there for the first year of his life.
		In 1928 Shastri became an active and mature member of the Indian National Congress at the call of Mahatma Gandhi. 
		He was imprisoned for two and a half years.
		<br>Shastri died in Tashkent, Uzbekistan (then Soviet Union) on 11 January 1966, one day after signing a peace treaty 
		to end the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War. 
		Many among Shastri's supporters and close relatives, refused at the time, and have refused since,
		to believe the circumstances of his death and allege foul play.
