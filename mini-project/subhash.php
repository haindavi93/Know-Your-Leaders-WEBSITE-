        <p>Subhas Chandra Bose was born to Prabhavati Bose  and Janakinath Bose on 23 January 1897 in Cuttackâ€”in
		what is today the state of Odisha in India, but was then the Orissa Division of Bengal Province in British 
		India.
		Subhas Bose, aged 24, arrived ashore in India at Bombay on the morning of 16 July 1921 
		and immediately set about arranging an interview with Mahatma Gandhi.
		In the consensus of scholarly opinion, Subhas Chandra Bose's death occurred from third-degree burns on 
		18 August 1945 after his overloaded Japanese plane crashed in Japanese-ruled Formosa (now Taiwan).
		However, many among his supporters, especially in Bengal, refused at the time, and have refused since,
		to believe either the fact or the circumstances of his death.
