        <p>Patel, one of the six children of Jhaverbhai Patel and Ladba, was born in Nadiad, Gujarat.
	 
		National Unity Day was introduced by the Government of India and inaugurated by Indian Prime Minister
		Narendra Modi in 2014.
		The intent is to pay tribute to Patel, who was instrumental in keeping India united. 
		It is to be celebrated on 31 October every year as annual commemoration of the birthday of the Iron Man 
		of India Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, one of the founding leaders of Republic of India. 
		After suffering a massive heart attack (his second), Patel died on 15 December 1950 at Birla House 
		in Bombay.In an unprecedented and unrepeated gesture, on the day after his death more than
		1,500 officers of India's civil and police services congregated to mourn at Patel's residence in
		Delhi and pledged "complete loyalty and unremitting zeal" in India's service.
