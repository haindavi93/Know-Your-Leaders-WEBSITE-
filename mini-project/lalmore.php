        <p>Lal Bahadur Shastri, (born October 2, 1904, Mughalsarai, 
India—died January 11, 1966, Tashkent, Uzbekistan, U.S.S.R.), 
Indian statesman, prime minister of India (1964–66) 
after Jawaharlal Nehru.<br>

<br>A member of Mahatma Gandhi’s noncooperation movement against 
British government in India, he was imprisoned for a short time 
(1921). Upon release he studied in the Kashi Vidyapitha, a 
nationalist university, where he graduated with the title 
of shastri (“learned in the scriptures”). He then returned to politics 
as a follower of Gandhi, was imprisoned several more times, and 
attained influential positions in the Congress Party of the state of 
the United Provinces, now Uttar Pradesh state.<br>

<br>Shastri was elected to the legislature of the United Provinces in 1937 
and 1946. After Indian independence, Shastri gained experience as 
minister for home affairs and transport in Uttar Pradesh. He was 
elected to the central Indian legislature in 1952 and became union 
minister for railways and transport. He gained a reputation as a 
skillful mediator after his appointment to the influential post of 
minister for home affairs in 1961. Three years later, on Jawaharlal 
Nehru’s illness, Shastri was appointed minister without portfolio, 
and after Nehru’s death he became prime minister in June 1964.<br>

<br>Title / Office : prime minister (1964-1966), India<br>

<br>Shastri was criticized for failing to deal effectively with India’s 
economic problems, but he won great popularity for his firmness on 
the outbreak of hostilities with neighbouring Pakistan (1965) over 
the disputed Kashmir region. He died of a heart attack after signing 
a “no-war” agreement with Pres. Ayub Khan of Pakistan and was 
succeeded as prime minister by Indira Gandhi, Nehru’s daughter.<br>
