        <p>Aruna Asaf Ali was born on 16 July 1909 in Kalka, Punjab, British India (now in Haryana, India) into a 
		Bengali Brahmo family. Her father Upendranath Ganguly hailed from Barisal district of Eastern Bengal 
		(now Bangladesh) but settled in the United Province.
		Aruna was educated at Sacred Heart Convent in Lahore and then at All Saints' College in Nainital.
		After her graduation, she worked as a teacher at the Gokhale Memorial School in Calcutta. 
		She met Asaf Ali, a leader in the Congress party, in Allahabad. 
		Young Aruna Asaf Ali presided over the remainder of the session on 9 August and hoisted the 
		Congress flag at the Gowalia Tank Maidan. This marked the commencement of the movement. 
		They got married in 1928, despite parental opposition on grounds of religion and age.
		She died in New Delhi on 29 July 1996, aged 87.
