        <p>Bhagat Singh was a Sandhu Jat born in 1907 to Kishan Singh and Vidyavati at Chak No. 105 GB, 
		Banga village, Jaranwala Tehsil in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab Province of British India, 
		present day Pakistan.The methods he used to convey his message, such as shooting Saunders, and throwing
		non-lethal bombs, stood in stark contrast to Gandhi's non-violent methodology 
		however Gandhi condemned the act of violence but he still considered him to be a great patriot
		and martyr.
		<br>
		The youth of India still draw tremendous amount of inspiration from Singh.
		He was voted the "Greatest Indian" in a poll by the Indian magazine India Today in 2008, 
		ahead of Bose and Gandhi.
